I'm a fifth year Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I am advised by [Mohit Bansal](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/). Before this, I graduated with a bachelor's and masters' degree from Columbia University, advised by [Kathleen McKeown](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/). My research interest is in natural language processing. My work at UNC is supported by a [Google PhD fellowship](https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/).
